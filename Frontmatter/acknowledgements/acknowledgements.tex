Dr.~Ross and Lauren Nowak, my peerless collaborators.
I deeply appreciate your brilliance and boundless patience with me.
It was such a privilege to work with you both.
\newline\newline
All the faculty of the mathematics department, amazing mathematicians and educators each.
Thank you to Dr.~Ardila and Dr.~Beck in particular for your guidance and aid in the writing of this thesis.
\newline\newline
My friends and colleagues in the department, who made one of the most welcoming communities I've ever been a part of.
\newline\newline
My friends, family, and loved ones --- in particular Andy Fukuba --- whose support for my occasionally odd life choices is invaluable.
None of this would be possible without you all.
