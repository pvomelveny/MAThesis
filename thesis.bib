  abstract = {We study the class of Lorentzian polynomials. The class contains homogeneous stable polynomials as well as volume polynomials of convex bodies and projective varieties. We prove that the Hessian of a nonzero Lorentzian polynomial has exactly one positive eigenvalue at any point on the positive orthant. This property can be seen as an analog of the Hodge--Riemann relations for Lorentzian polynomials. Lorentzian polynomials are intimately connected to matroid theory and negative dependence properties. We show that matroids, and more generally M-convex sets, are characterized by the Lorentzian property, and develop a theory around Lorentzian polynomials. In particular, we provide a large class of linear operators that preserve the Lorentzian property and prove that Lorentzian measures enjoy several negative dependence properties. We also prove that the class of tropicalized Lorentzian polynomials coincides with the class of M-convex functions in the sense of discrete convex analysis. The tropical connection is used to produce Lorentzian polynomials from M-convex functions. We give two applications of the general theory. First, we prove thatthe homogenized multivariate Tutte polynomial of a matroid is Lorentzian whenever the parameter \$q\$ satisfies \$0 \textbackslash lt q \textbackslash le 1\$. Consequences are proofs of the strongest Mason's conjecture from 1972 and negative dependence properties of the random cluster model in statistical physics. Second, we prove that the multivariate characteristic polynomial of an M-matrix is Lorentzian. This refines a result of Holtz who proved that the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of an M-matrix form an ultra log-concave sequence.},

  abstract = {In a recent paper, the first author proved the log-concavity of the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of a matroid realizable over a field of characteristic 0, answering a long-standing conjecture of Read in graph theory. We extend the proof to all realizable matroids, making progress towards a more general conjecture of Rota–Heron–Welsh. Our proof follows from an identification of the coefficients of the reduced characteristic polynomial as answers to particular intersection problems on a toric variety. The log-concavity then follows from an inequality of Hodge type.},

We describe certain closed convex polyhedral cones of divisors for which the “volume” of each divisor in the cone—that is, the degree of its top power—is equal to the volume of the associated normal complexes. For the Bergman fan of any matroid with building set, we prove that there exists an open family of such cones of divisors with nonempty interiors. We view the theory of normal complexes developed in this paper as a polytopal model underlying the combinatorial Hodge theory pioneered by Adiprasito, Huh, and Katz.},

That same year, Amini and Piquerez established that mixed degrees of divisors of certain classes of tropical fans are log-concave [2]. Given that mixed volumes also generate log-concave sequences, we develop a definition of mixed volumes of normal complexes as a step toward the larger goal of proving that log-concavity holds for mixed degrees of divisors of a broader class of tropical fans. Since this larger goal will require inductive arguments, we also describe the face structure of a normal complex and discuss how to apply the face structure toward recursive volume computations.},

  abstract = {A classic problem in mathematics is solving systems of polynomial equations in several unknowns. Today, polynomial models are ubiquitous and widely used across the sciences. They arise in robotics, coding theory, optimization, mathematical biology, computer vision, game theory, statistics, and numerous other areas. {$<$}P{$>$}This book furnishes a bridge across mathematical disciplines and exposes many facets of systems of polynomial equations. It covers a wide spectrum of mathematical techniques and algorithms, both symbolic and numerical. {$<$}P{$>$}The set of solutions to a system of polynomial equations is an algebraic variety--the basic object of algebraic geometry. The algorithmic study of algebraic varieties is the central theme of computational algebraic geometry. Exciting recent developments in computer software for geometric calculations have revolutionized the field. Formerly inaccessible problems are now tractable, providing fertile ground for experimentation and conjecture. {$<$}P{$>$}The first half of the book gives a snapshot of the state of the art of the topic. Familiar themes are covered in the first five chapters, including polynomials in one variable, Gröbner bases of zero-dimensional ideals, Newton polytopes and Bernstein's Theorem, multidimensional resultants, and primary decomposition. {$<$}P{$>$}The second half of the book explores polynomial equations from a variety of novel and unexpected angles. It introduces interdisciplinary connections, discusses highlights of current research, and outlines possible future algorithms. Topics include computation of Nash equilibria in game theory, semidefinite programming and the real Nullstellensatz, the algebraic geometry of statistical models, the piecewise-linear geometry of valuations and amoebas, and the Ehrenpreis-Palamodov theorem on linear partial differential equations with constant coefficients. {$<$}P{$>$}Throughout the text, there are many hands-on examples and exercises, including short but complete sessions in Maple®, MATLAB®, Macaulay 2, Singular, PHCpack, CoCoA, and SOSTools. These examples will be particularly useful for readers with no background in algebraic geometry or commutative algebra. Within minutes, readers can learn how to type in polynomial equations and actually see some meaningful results on their computer screens. {$<$}P{$>$}Prerequisites include basic abstract and computational algebra. The book is designed as a text for a graduate course in computational algebra.},
