We use the Hodge-Riemann relations to resolve a conjecture of Heron, Rota, and Welsh that postulates the log-concavity of the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of M. We furthermore conclude that the \$f\$-vector of the independence complex of a matroid forms a log-concave sequence, proving a conjecture of Mason and Welsh for general matroids.},

  abstract = {Associated to any divisor in the Chow ring of a simplicial tropical fan, we construct a family of polytopal complexes, called normal complexes, which we propose as an analogue of the well-studied notion of normal polytopes from the setting of complete fans. We describe certain closed convex polyhedral cones of divisors for which the "volume" of each divisor in the cone - that is, the degree of its top power - is equal to the volume of the associated normal complexes. For the Bergman fan of any matroid with building set, we prove that there exists an open family of such cones of divisors with nonempty interiors. We view the theory of normal complexes developed in this paper as a polytopal model underlying the combinatorial Hodge theory pioneered by Adiprasito, Huh, and Katz.},

Matroids are of fundamental importance in combinatorial optimization and their applications extend into electrical and structural engineering. This book falls into two parts: the first provides a comprehensive introduction to the basics of matroid theory, while the second treats more advanced topics. It contains over 700 exercises, and includes proofs of all of the major theorems in the subject. The last two chapters review current research and list more than eighty unsolved problems along with a description of the progress towards their solutions.},
