\chapter{Chow Rings}

It is time now to delve into the world of algebra, developing the notion of a Chow ring of a matroid.
Much of section will be presenting results of Adiprasito-Huh-Katz that establish the link between the Chow ring and the characteristic polynomial.

This is going to be a section that will be challenging to parse without some background in abstract algebra.
Even with a basic background, Chow rings are somewhat specialized, a development of intersection theory in algebraic geometry.
Not something everyone has seen for sure.
Luckily, we can exploit the structure of matroids to define a Chow ring without having to go the long way through intersection theory.

\section{Defining a Chow Ring}

A Chow ring is ``a generalization of cohomology for alegbraic geometry''
\todo{Introduce the Chow Ring of a matroid. From lattice of flats to quotient ring}
\todo{Use our example matroid and construct its Chow Ring}

\subsection{Properties of Chow Rings}
\todo{Use words like \emph{homogeneous polynomial}, \emph{graded ring}, etc\dots}

\subsection{The Degree Map}
\todo{How do I explain this?
    I guess I can at least say it's linear and sends terms of full degree to 1.
    Maybe I'll understand it this time around}


\section{Relationship with the Characteristic Polynomial}

\todo{Come up with a nice way of relating the reduced characteristic polynomial with our ring (and therefore fan)}
\todo{Define \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\). Here or in a subsection? Or should it be up when we introduce the ring itself?}
