\chapter{Introduction}

Welcome to this thesis.

\section{Why are we doing this?}

\todo{Introduce the Heron-Rota-Welsh Conjecture. Should I not call it that now that we know it's not just conjecture?}
\todo{I should probably have H-R-W papers as references. Go find those.}
\todo{Why should you care? Let me tell you, briefly.}

\section{What have other people been doing?}
\todo{Talk about A-H-K. Maybe some other people working in this area.}

\section{What are we going to do here?}
\todo{Lay out the general game plan and what we want to show.
    Maybe outline the trade-offs of this version of the proof vs. A-H-K to motivate why this is worth doing.}
